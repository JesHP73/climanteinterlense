I believe that some people get sicker from air pollution than others because of where they live :house_buildings: or how much money :euro: they have. Intersectionality, in the context of Climate and socio-economic data, refers to the recognition that individuals and communities are shaped by multiple intersecting social identities and factors. It emphasises that people's experiences and vulnerabilities are not determined by a single characteristic or variable but are the result of the interplay between various dimensions of identity and social context. These dimensions can include gender, race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, age, and more.")
